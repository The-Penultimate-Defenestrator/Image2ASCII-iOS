**NOTE: this is *not* the core application. `Image2ASCII` lives [here](https://github.com/controversial/Image2ASCII). This is merely a thin `ui` on top of it to make it nicer in Pythonista.**

# Image2ASCII-iOS
An iOS app for converting images to ASCII art. Designed to be run from pythonista.

Take an image or pick one from camera roll, then convert to ASCII art and share.

This is probably my project I'm proudest of, I spent a long time on it, and it's what taught me the `ui` module. So [here it is](! Example:
